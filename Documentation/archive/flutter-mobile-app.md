## Integration with Existing API

### API Endpoints to Integrate
Based on the existing NestJS API structure:

1. **File Upload**: `POST /upload` - Upload PDF files
2. **Quiz Generation**: `GET /generate-quiz-stream/:filename` - Real-time streaming quiz generation
3. **Quiz Retrieval**: `GET /quiz/:quizId` - Get generated quiz by ID
4. **Quiz Management**: Various endpoints for quiz CRUD operations
5. **Configuration**: `GET /config` - Get API configuration

### Real-time Features
- **Streaming Quiz Generation**: WebSocket/SSE integration for real-time quiz generation progress
- **Live Updates**: Real-time feedback during PDF processing and AI question generation

## Technical Architecture

### State Management Strategy
- **Riverpod**: Primary state management solution
- **Provider Pattern**: For dependency injection
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences for app settings and cache

### API Integration
- **Dio HTTP Client**: For robust API communication with interceptors
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Offline Support**: Cache generated quizzes for offline access

### File Management
- **File Picker**: Native file selection for PDF uploads
- **Permission Handler**: Manage storage and file access permissions
- **Path Provider**: Handle local file storage and caching

## UI/UX Design Principles

### Material Design 3
- Modern Material Design components
- Consistent color theming matching web app
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Bottom navigation with clear sections
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during quiz generation
- **Offline Indicators**: Clear status of network connectivity
- **Accessibility**: Full screen reader and accessibility support

## Platform-Specific Features

### iOS
- Native iOS design patterns where appropriate
- iOS-specific file handling and sharing
- Leverage iOS security features

### Android
- Material Design 3 components
- Android-specific file management
- System integration features

## Security Considerations

### API Security
- Secure API key storage
- HTTPS-only communication
- Request authentication and validation

### Local Security
- Secure local storage for sensitive data
- Biometric authentication options
- Data encryption for cached content

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management
- Lazy loading of quiz content
- Efficient image and file caching
- Memory-conscious state management

### Network Optimization
- Request caching and deduplication
- Efficient streaming implementation
- Offline-first approach where possible

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Model serialization/deserialization
- Service layer functionality
- Utility functions

### Widget Tests
- Individual component testing
- Screen navigation testing
- User interaction testing

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end user workflows
- API integration testing
- File upload and processing flows

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Local development with API proxy
- Hot reload for rapid development
- Debug builds with development API

### Production
- Release builds with production API
- App store optimization
- Analytics and crash reporting integration

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- Offline quiz taking capability
- Quiz sharing and collaboration
- Advanced analytics and progress tracking
- Multi-language support (matching web app's 16 languages)

### Platform Extensions
- iPad optimization with split-screen support
- Android tablet layouts
- Desktop support (Windows/macOS/Linux)
