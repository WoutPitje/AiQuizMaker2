# Terraform Static Hosting Module Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes applied to the static hosting module for the AiQuizMaker project.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Incomplete main.tf File
**Problem**: The main.tf file was missing a closing brace and several essential resources.

**Solution**: 
- Added the missing closing brace
- Added IAM configuration for public bucket access
- Implemented complete load balancer setup with:
  - Backend bucket configuration
  - URL mapping
  - HTTP/HTTPS proxies
  - Global forwarding rules
  - Static IP address allocation

### 2. Incomplete outputs.tf File
**Problem**: The outputs.tf file was cut off mid-definition.

**Solution**: 
- Completed the `website_url` output
- Added additional outputs:
  - `static_ip_address`: The global static IP
  - `cdn_enabled`: CDN status
  - `load_balancer_ip`: Load balancer IP
  - `backend_bucket_id`: Backend bucket resource ID
  - `cost_estimate`: Monthly cost estimation

### 3. Missing Resources
**Problem**: The module lacked essential resources for production-ready static hosting.

**Solution**: Added the following resources:
- `google_storage_bucket_iam_member`: Makes bucket publicly accessible
- `google_compute_backend_bucket`: Backend bucket for load balancer
- `google_compute_url_map`: URL routing configuration
- `google_compute_target_http_proxy`: HTTP proxy
- `google_compute_target_https_proxy`: HTTPS proxy (conditional)
- `google_compute_managed_ssl_certificate`: SSL certificate (conditional)
- `google_compute_global_forwarding_rule`: HTTP and HTTPS forwarding rules
- `google_compute_global_address`: Static IP address

## Architecture

### Basic Flow
1. User requests → Global Load Balancer (via static IP)
2. Load Balancer → Backend Bucket
3. Backend Bucket → Cloud Storage Bucket
4. Cloud Storage serves static files

### Features Implemented

#### 1. CDN Support
- Optional Cloud CDN integration
- Configurable via `enable_cdn` variable
- Optimized cache policies when enabled

#### 2. Custom Domain Support
- Optional custom domain configuration
- Automatic SSL certificate provisioning
- HTTPS redirect when domain is configured

#### 3. Cost Optimization
- Lifecycle rules to delete old versions after 90 days
- CDN is optional (saves ~$18/month when disabled)
- Efficient caching policies

#### 4. Security
- Uniform bucket-level access
- Public read-only access for web serving
- CORS configuration for API integration

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests in `terraform/modules/static_hosting/tests/static_hosting_test.tf`:
- Test 1: Basic configuration without CDN or custom domain
- Test 2: Configuration with CDN enabled
- Test 3: Configuration with custom domain

## Usage Example

```hcl
module "static_hosting" {
  source = "./modules/static_hosting"
  
  project_id  = "my-project"
  region      = "us-central1"
  environment = "prod"
  
  # Optional features
  enable_cdn  = true
  domain_name = "myapp.example.com"
  
  labels = {
    app = "aiquizmaker"
  }
}
```

## Cost Breakdown

- **Without CDN**: ~$1/month (storage and minimal bandwidth)
- **With CDN**: ~$19/month (includes CDN service charge)
- Additional costs may apply for bandwidth usage

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the frontend build to the storage bucket
2. Configure DNS records if using custom domain
3. Test the static site access via load balancer IP
4. Monitor CDN performance if enabled
